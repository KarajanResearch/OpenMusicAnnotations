# OpenMusicAnnotations

## Description

Welcome to the Open Music Annotation Cloud, a database for any type of terms, tags, or attributes that humans associate with audible music. 

The project was started and funded by https://karajan-research.org to collect and share musical data of various research projects.

### What is a Recording

The center of all musical data in the Open Music Annotation Cloud is the recording, i.e., music recorded to a medium (usually WAV files).

In classical music, virtually any piece audible today was composed long before artists interpreted it and have recorded that interpretation to a medium. For example, Beethoven composed his symphonies long before Herbert von Karajan was born. Much later Karajan decides to interpret a Beethoven symphony with his orchestra of choice. Once he was happy with the result Karajan and the orchestra performed the symphony and have a record company create a recording of that concert and sell that recording on mediums such as records, CDs, or Spotify.

On the other hand, music can happen very differently from the classic approach. For example, a group of musicians can book a studio, setup for live recording and create a recording of completely improvised music. The result is also a recording that can be distributed through any music medium but there are no references to any composition.

The minimum recording information in the Open Music Annotation Cloud is a title and a WAV file.
