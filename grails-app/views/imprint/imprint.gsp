following services: Infrastructure and platform services,
computing capacity, storage space and database services, e-mail

that we use for the purpose of operating this website.</p> <p>We, or our hosting provider, collect the following data on the

deleted. Data whose further storage is required for evidentiary
purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective
incident has been finally clarified.</p> <p>Further information about Amazon Web Services can be found on
